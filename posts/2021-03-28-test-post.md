After some trial and errors and a few searches on google i have finally managed to  log in to my admin account. previously i had been getting the error: <!--StartFragment-->

 “*Git Gateway Error*: *Please ask your site administrator to reissue the Git Gateway token*.”

<!--EndFragment-->. Imanaged to fix the issue by changing the branch from master to main in my config.yaml file.

The process continues the learning continues.
