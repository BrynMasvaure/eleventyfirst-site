  <p>Entrepreneurship – A case for an online presence
Just a peak into the list of the world’s most valuable companies (by market capitalization) you will find that four of the top ten are internet based companies. For a clearer picture let’s plug in the numbers:</p>
<p>Recently we have had giants like Amazon (AMZN) whose market value surged 59.8% from (1898.03 to 3033.53 per share) as inhabitants of earth voluntarily or involuntarily became heavy proponents of e-commerce. I will not even attempt to zoom into the ZOOM story; it is another one which deserves its own article. Now as the global compass is constantly directing us towards this digital (online) route, it begs us to ask: Should startups (Entrepreneurs in Africa) have an online strategy from inception?</p>
<p>Africa is endowed with a vast collection of natural phenomena, resources and most importantly a vibrant young population which represents a lot of digital (online) penetration potential. Africa presents herself as an environment with the fastest internet growth rates and I strongly believe entrepreneurs should embrace this as an opportunity. Below is a table showing internet user statistics for six Southern African countries:</p>
<p>As the internet usage in Africa grows exponentially it is critical that every entrepreneur/start have an online presence or incorporate a digital module in their overall business strategy. There are many benefits to this, key of which are discussed below.</p>
<p>Why have an online presence?</p>
<ol>
<li>Marketing</li>
</ol>
<p>It is cheaper as the majority of online platforms and social media platforms are free. Most startups are bootstrapped and they have little or no marketing budgets so it makes a lot of sense to use platforms like Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp etc. an online presence gives your brand a huge audience and as the figures indicate social media usage has been growing exponentially so this presence an easier place to make your brand and products visible. Marketing is the most important factor in business and product growth. No matter how good a product is the customer has to know it first to buy it.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>24/7 Accessibility</li>
</ol>
<p>The internet does not sleep! Your brand and products once on the internet will be accessible to those numbers from Table2 even if you the entrepreneur is asleep. This means the impact of reaching potential clients and customers is multiplied and we can just imagine the impact on revenues.</p>
<p>There are many other benefits to having an online presence but in this article I have focused on just these two. I hope we continue on our journey and if you want more information on online presence there are many resources on the internet- they are so many it will be unfair for me to recommend one.</p>
<p>Numbers do not lie</p>
